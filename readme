This game is inspired by Three Piggies of Smart Games Company. My wife bought this game for my daughter, and I thought this could be an excellent programming practice, for an amateur programmer :P
 
The original game can be bought/checked out here. I recommend you watch some youtube videos to better understand the mechanics.

I will make improvements, including:
1. make a decent GUI. 
2. customizable board and houses. 
3. better and cleaner code, esp. House class and class inheritance.
